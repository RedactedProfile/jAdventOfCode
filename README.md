This is just my silly little Java based Advent of Code Framework and Day Runner. 
All participated days across all participated years are in this one program. 

Run
```
java src/main/java/com/redactedprofile/Main.java 
```

CLI options
```
--year -y    (2015, 2024, etc)
--day -d     (1, 10, 31, etc)
--part -p    (1 or 2 or none for both)
--sample -s  (true or false, default to false)
```


### FAQ  
(im just kidding, no one is asking) 

Q: Why java  
A: Because I want to get better at Java   
  
Q: Why not Kotlin   
A: Oh don't worry, there's going to be some kotlin in here too. There might be whole day's using Kotlin instead of Java.  They're interopable, so I'm gonna do whatever I feel like it.  And I mean, gimme a break and I'm an indecisive jackass.  
  
Q: Why not spin up a thread per Day?   
A: Because the main thread is fine, but I want to reserve as many available threads for the Day's themselves to use if I want to  
  
Q: Can I use this framework?  
A: I mean, feel free lol just strip out my stuff and use yours instead. Don't forget to inform the Registry of each Day
